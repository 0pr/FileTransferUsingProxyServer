# FileTransferUsingProxyServer

This project is based on file transmission using MP QUIC for step 1 and implementation of the paper M. Kheirkhah and M. Lee, "AMP: An Adaptive Multipath TCP for Data Center Networks," 2019 (IFIP Networking), Warsaw, Poland, 2019, pp. 1-9, doi: 10.23919/IFIPNetworking.2019.8816848.

In Step 1 we have successfully transfered file from server to client using Multi Path QUIC transfer Protocol.
We have used the decocninck mpquic repository.First we have downloaded all the required dependencies like go,quicgo minitopo
and minitopo extensions.
We have made a few changes in the code of client.
In particular we  have initialised the variable to store the response from the server.Then a new file is created which has same name as that of server and contents of the variable in it are placed in it.The file name variable is initialised as the last path of the url given by the client.Then using wireshark we test the
transfer of file in single path as well as multipath.
